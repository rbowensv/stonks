This was for a coding challenge, make a stock viewer with some criteria(below). It was a fun practice in actually ground up and keeping myself on task and not veering off to make something perfect. This is very MVP. 

Requirements
Musts
Built in react
Some sort of unit testing
Nice to haves
Typescript
Integration tests
Continuous integration.
The user wants you to create a web application that will allow them to compare up to 3 stock tickers at once. They want to be able to search for companies based not just based on symbols but also names. For example the user could search for PLTR and Palantir.

A data source you could use is https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/ (Free API key available). Here are a few user stories that the customer wants:

As a user, I want to be able to search for a company by symbol or full name so that I can be able to search for ‘AAL’ and ‘airlines’.

As a user, I want to be able to pin/bookmark up to 3 results to my view so that I can search for companies and add them to the view without losing track of companies I am interested in.

As a user, I want to be able to see up to 3 pinned columns so that I can draw direct comparisons across the data sets.

As a user, I want to be able to see the graphical representation of a company’s EPS earning or cash flow and be able to compare it across the 3 selected companies.

Below is all the cruft from Create React App

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
